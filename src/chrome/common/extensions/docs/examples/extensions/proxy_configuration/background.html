      Here, we'll hook into the proxy extension API's `onProxyError`
      event, and use it to set a warning badge on the browser action's icon.
      Additionally, we'll store proxy settings locally, and reset them when the
      background page initializes.  This is essential, as incognito settings
      are wiped on restart.
